  Our team decided to investigate the effect of an existing war and how that is reflected on stock prices for weapon manufacturers and stock prices for gas companies and how those can effect the cost of crude oil, housing prices and the unemployment rate. Our time references for wars are the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the Ukrainian/Russian conflict.

The business question we hope to answer is *if we can predict an increase or decline in stock prices for weapon manufacturers and gas companies when there is an existing war. Additionally, we hope to be able to answer if we can predict a rise or decline in crude oil prices, housing prices, and the unemployment rate when there is an existing war.*

Our motivation for taking on this challenge is to find out if there is clear causation or merely a correlation between the effect of war on stock prices as well as crude oil prices, housing prices and unemployment rates.

We hope to find this data using stock data from Nasdaq and Alpaca, the cost of crude oil from eia.gov, the cost of housing prices from Data.gov, and the effect on unemployment rates from the US Department of Labor.
